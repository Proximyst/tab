== FAQ

These are a few perhaps commonly asked questions.

=== Can I use this?

Perhaps. You should probably still hold off, as it's not a set-in-stone
product, but it does _work_ and is _usable_.

=== Why is the licence header is missing in X & Y?

The licence header is only updated (`:licenseFormat` task) right before a tag.
If a tag has not been pushed recently, that would be the reason why.
